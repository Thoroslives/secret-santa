Our Secret Santa app handles the entire process digitally, from group creation to wishlist management and random assignments."

      q: "How does the Secret Santa Generator work?",
      a: "It's simple! Create a group and set an admin password. Then add participants with their names and optional email addresses. Share the invite code with your group. Each person logs in to create their wishlist. When everyone is ready, the admin clicks one button to generate random assignments. Each participant then sees who they're buying for and can view their recipient's wishlist."

      q: "Is this Secret Santa app free?",
      a: "Yes, our Secret Santa generator is free for groups of up to 10 participants. You get unlimited groups, wishlist management, and random assignments at no cost. If you need more than 10 people in a group, you can unlock unlimited participants with a one-time $10 payment."

      q: "Can I set a gift budget for my Secret Santa group?",
      a: "Absolutely! Admins can set a gift budget with multi-currency support including USD, EUR, GBP, ZAR, CAD, AUD, and many more currencies. The budget is displayed to all participants so everyone knows the spending limit for their gift."

      q: "How do wishlists work in the Secret Santa app?",
      a: "Each participant can add up to 5 items to their personal wishlist, including item names and direct links to products online. When Secret Santa assignments are generated, each gift giver can see their assigned recipient's wishlist, making it easy to choose the perfect gift."

      q: "Can I use this for an office Secret Santa?",
      a: "Our Secret Santa generator is perfect for office gift exchanges!
